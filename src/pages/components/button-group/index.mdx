## Design Guidelines

### When to Use
- **Related actions**: Buttons that perform similar or complementary functions
- **Action sets**: Save/Cancel, Previous/Next, Accept/Decline pairs
- **Toolbars**: Sets of tools or commands in applications
- **Bulk actions**: Multiple operations on selected content
- **Workflow steps**: Sequential actions in a process

### When Not to Use
- **Unrelated actions**: Buttons that serve different purposes
- **Primary navigation**: Use appropriate navigation components
- **Single actions**: Individual buttons don't need grouping
- **Complex forms**: Use proper form layout patterns

### Button Hierarchy
- Place primary action first (left in LTR languages)
- Use consistent button variants within groups
- Limit primary buttons to one per group
- Order actions by frequency of use
- Consider cultural reading patterns

### Spacing and Layout
- Use consistent spacing between buttons
- Align buttons based on text baseline
- Maintain visual balance in mixed-size groups
- Consider responsive behavior for mobile
- Provide adequate touch targets

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Support
- **Tab**: Moves focus between buttons in the group
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between buttons in segmented groups
- **Enter/Space**: Activates the focused button
- **Home/End**: Move to first/last button in arrow key navigation

### Screen Reader Support
- Button groups are announced as a cohesive unit when appropriate
- Individual buttons maintain their semantic meaning
- Selected states in segmented groups are communicated
- Button relationships are clear through proper grouping

### Focus Management
- Clear focus indicators on all buttons
- Focus moves logically through the button sequence
- Focus is trapped appropriately in modal contexts
- Initial focus placement follows expected patterns

### ARIA Support
- Uses `role="group"` with appropriate `aria-label` when needed
- Segmented groups use `role="radiogroup"` for single selection
- Selected states use `aria-pressed` or `aria-selected`
- Buttons maintain individual accessible names

### Best Practices
- Provide clear, descriptive labels for all buttons
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all button states
- Maintain consistent interaction patterns within groups
- Use appropriate roles for different group types
- Don't rely solely on visual grouping for meaning
