## Overview

*Purpose: Establish context and help designers/developers understand when and why to use this component.*

### When to Use Empty States
- **First-time use**: When users haven't created any content yet
- **Search results**: When searches return no matching items
- **Data tables**: When filters exclude all data or no data exists
- **Error states**: When content failed to load or isn't available
- **Completed tasks**: When all items are processed or cleared

### When NOT to Use Empty States
- **Loading content**: Use skeleton screens or loading indicators instead
- **Temporary states**: For brief moments between content updates
- **Partial content**: When some content exists but more is loading
- **Navigation errors**: Use proper error pages for 404s and similar issues

## Variations

*Purpose: Show designers all available visual options and their semantic meaning to make informed design decisions.*

### Context Types

<InlineNotification kind="info">
Empty State components are currently in development. Examples shown represent planned functionality.
</InlineNotification>

**First Use** welcomes new users and guides them toward creating their first content.

**No Results** explains when searches or filters return empty results with suggestions for refinement.

**Error State** communicates when content is unavailable due to problems with helpful recovery actions.

**Completed** celebrates when users have finished all tasks or processed all items.

### Visual Elements

**Illustration Focus** uses meaningful graphics to communicate context and mood.

**Text Focus** emphasizes clear messaging with minimal visual elements.

**Action Focus** highlights primary actions users should take next.

**Educational Focus** provides learning resources and guidance for new users.

## Design Principles

*Purpose: Understand the foundational UI principles that guide effective empty state design and prevent common mistakes.*

### Empathy Principle
**Acknowledge user emotions and provide encouragement.** Empty states can feel disappointing or confusing. Good empty states validate user feelings and provide positive, helpful guidance rather than blame or confusion.

### Clarity Principle  
**Explain what happened and why in simple terms.** Users encountering empty states need to understand the situation quickly. Technical jargon or vague explanations increase confusion and frustration.

### Action Orientation Principle
**Guide users toward productive next steps.** Empty states should not be dead ends. They should suggest clear, actionable ways for users to move forward with their goals.

### Context Relevance Principle
**Tailor messaging and actions to the specific situation.** Generic empty states miss opportunities to provide relevant, helpful guidance based on what users were trying to accomplish.

## Best Practices

*Purpose: Apply design principles through specific, actionable guidelines that prevent common empty state design mistakes.*

### Writing Helpful Messaging

**Why this matters:** Confusing or blame-focused messaging makes users feel lost or frustrated. Clear, encouraging messaging helps users understand the situation and feel confident about next steps.

### Providing Relevant Actions

**Why this matters:** Empty states without clear next steps become dead ends in user workflows. Relevant actions help users continue toward their goals rather than abandoning tasks.

### Using Appropriate Visual Tone

**Why this matters:** Visual mood affects user emotional response to empty states. Overly negative or overly playful visuals can create inappropriate emotional context for the situation.

## Implementation

*Purpose: Provide developers with practical implementation guidance and common usage patterns, not exhaustive technical reference (see Storybook for complete API docs).*

### Getting Started

```bash
npm install @inform-elevate/elevate-core-ui
```

```javascript
// Import all components
import '@inform-elevate/elevate-core-ui';

// Or import specific components  
import '@inform-elevate/elevate-core-ui/dist/components/empty-state/empty-state.js';
```

### Planned Usage Patterns

```html
<!-- First use state -->
<elvt-empty-state type="first-use">
  <elvt-icon slot="illustration" icon="mdi:folder-plus"></elvt-icon>
  <h3 slot="title">Create your first project</h3>
  <p slot="description">Projects help you organize your work and collaborate with your team.</p>
  <elvt-button slot="action" tone="primary">Create Project</elvt-button>
</elvt-empty-state>

<!-- No results state -->
<elvt-empty-state type="no-results">
  <elvt-icon slot="illustration" icon="mdi:magnify"></elvt-icon>
  <h3 slot="title">No results found</h3>
  <p slot="description">Try adjusting your search terms or filters.</p>
  <elvt-button slot="action">Clear Filters</elvt-button>
</elvt-empty-state>

<!-- Error state -->
<elvt-empty-state type="error">
  <elvt-icon slot="illustration" icon="mdi:cloud-off"></elvt-icon>
  <h3 slot="title">Unable to load content</h3>
  <p slot="description">Check your connection and try again.</p>
  <elvt-button slot="action" tone="primary">Retry</elvt-button>
</elvt-empty-state>
```

### Key Properties

The most commonly planned properties for design and development:

<PageTable>

## Interactive Examples

*Purpose: Allow designers and developers to test empty state behavior and copy working code for their projects.*

<InlineNotification kind="info">
Interactive examples will be available when the Empty State component is implemented. Check back in future releases for live demonstrations.
</InlineNotification>

## Accessibility

*Purpose: Ensure your empty state implementations are usable by all users, including those with disabilities.*

### Essential Accessibility Practices

**Semantic structure:**
- Use proper heading hierarchy for empty state titles
- Provide descriptive text that explains the situation
- Include alternative text for illustrations and icons
- Structure content logically for screen reader navigation

**Focus management:**
- Primary action buttons should be keyboard accessible
- Logical tab order through empty state elements
- Clear focus indicators on interactive elements
- Don't trap focus unless in modal contexts

**Screen reader support:**
- Announce empty state changes when content updates
- Use appropriate ARIA labels for context
- Provide clear action descriptions
- Communicate loading states during content refresh

**Visual accessibility:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text and illustrations
- Don't rely solely on color to convey state meaning
- Use clear, readable typography
- Provide alternative text for decorative illustrations
