<PageDescription>

The ELEVATE Design System is built on four fundamental principles that guide every design decision, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and user-centricity across all experiences.

## 1. Accessibility First

Accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's fundamental to how we design. Every component, pattern, and guideline is created with accessibility as a core requirement.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels">
  
  ```html
  <button aria-label="Close dialog">
    <CloseIcon />
  </button>
  ```
  
  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Rely solely on visual cues for important information">
  
  ```html
  <div class="red-text">Error occurred</div>
  ```
  
  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Key Accessibility Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** – All components meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Keyboard Navigation** – Every interactive element is keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support** – Proper semantic markup and ARIA labels throughout
- **Color Contrast** – Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text and background colors

## 2. Consistency

Consistent experiences reduce cognitive load and build user confidence. Our design system provides standardized components, patterns, and guidelines that work harmoniously together.

### Visual Consistency

- **Typography Scale** – Consistent typographic hierarchy across all interfaces
- **Color Palette** – Carefully curated colors with defined usage guidelines
- **Spacing System** – Standardized spacing tokens for predictable layouts
- **Component Library** – Reusable components that behave consistently

### Behavioral Consistency

- **Interaction Patterns** – Standard behaviors for common actions
- **Navigation Models** – Consistent navigation paradigms
- **Feedback Systems** – Uniform success, error, and loading states

## 3. User-Centricity

Every design decision prioritizes user needs and context. We design for real people solving real problems, considering their goals, constraints, and diverse abilities.

### Human-Centered Approach

- **Task-Oriented Design** – Components support user goals efficiently
- **Context Awareness** – Adaptive interfaces that respond to user context
- **Inclusive Design** – Solutions that work for users with diverse needs
- **Usability Testing** – Regular validation with real users

### Design for Scale

- **Progressive Disclosure** – Complex information presented in digestible chunks
- **Responsive Design** – Seamless experiences across all device sizes
- **Performance Focus** – Fast, lightweight interfaces that respect user time

## 4. Systematic Thinking

ELEVATE is more than a collection of components—it's a cohesive system where every element relates to the whole.

### Design Tokens

Our design tokens ensure consistency at scale:

```css
/* Color tokens */
--elevate-primary: #6366f1;
--elevate-success: #10b981;
--elevate-error: #ef4444;

/* Spacing tokens */
--elevate-space-xs: 0.25rem;
--elevate-space-sm: 0.5rem;
--elevate-space-md: 1rem;
```

### Component Relationships

- **Atomic Design** – Components build from atoms to complex organisms
- **Composition Over Configuration** – Flexible building blocks that combine naturally
- **Shared Dependencies** – Common foundations reduce maintenance overhead

## Applying These Principles

When creating new components or patterns:

1. **Start with accessibility** – Consider all users from the beginning
2. **Follow established patterns** – Use existing components and conventions
3. **Test with real users** – Validate assumptions with user research
4. **Think systematically** – Consider how new elements fit the broader system

**Remember:** These principles work together. A truly great experience is accessible, consistent, user-centered, and systematic all at once.
